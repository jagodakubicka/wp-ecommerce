# Travel Guide to Japan

## About

This travel guide showcases my personal favorite places in Japan, offering insights and tips based on my experiences. To manage content effectively, I have utilized WordPress as a headless CMS. All posts and blogs are crafted within the WordPress dashboard, ensuring an intuitive content creation process. These entries are then seamlessly integrated into the fully customized Nuxt project through API connections, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
